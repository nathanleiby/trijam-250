- had a lot of fun doing a paper prototype of the game with playing cards
- syncing my mental model of gamestate (a few arrays) to nodes that have lots of other data hanging off them feels painful. is this the object oriented way?
- capturing mouse input -- not sure of best quick way
- working late at night (eep) is affecting clarity
- still not playable really at 2h15m.. scope too big or got distracted?
